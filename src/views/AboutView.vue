      <h2>The Early Days</h2>

      <p>Caleb grew up in the lava fields of a Norwegian volcano, where he learned the art of manhood by battling
        dragons and wooing maidens.
      </p>

      <p><em>The Hammer of the Gods</em>, they called him. Not just because of his strong fists, but also because of
        his
        stubborn nature. He was seen many a night, deep in the moonglow, beneath Odin's confused gaze, arguing with an
        actual fencepost.</p>

      <p>That fencepost? <em>Albert Einstein.</em></p>

      <p>When he wasn't busy saving babies from zombie ninjas or engaging in deep thought with the Old Ones of the
        Elder Mountain, he would play music.</p>

      <p>Soon, he would write, play, and dominate all aspects of the songwriting process. A self-taught master
        multi-instrumentalist, he
        writes songs that take your mind's eye to that dirt road on that late summer night, breathing clean with a
        racing
        heart
        as Becky leans in
        closer
        for a kiss. To your grandparents' porch, listening to the birds and life stories at the
        same time. They take you to that cold beer with your buddy, all while giving you that foot-stompin' feeling only
        Country music can offer.</p>

      <p>As he mastered the arts of writing and playing, he began to learn the craft of taking what he'd written and
        spreading it to the world through the mystical
        art
        of Production. Caleb writes and records all his own music, while also mixing and mastering his songs to not only
        industry standards, but to his own impossibly-high criteria. That's why the tunes you hear from Caleb Lovey
        are...well...so lovely.</p>
